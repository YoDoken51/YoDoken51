### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm going to do a few projects for my time as a programmer. Some of the upcoming casual projects are:
- A fishtank simulator game/app! Kind of like a virtual pet I guess...

Some of the current things I am doing right now:
- Programming a Roblox Game!
- Working on overthewire.org Bandit challenges!
- Working on hacker101 CTFs!
- Completing HackerRank Python challenges

I am currently an inexperienced programmer, and I don't have any projects on my portfolio. I plan to change that!
Here are some of the things I want to do:
- Work on server management
- Automate certain tasks, well enough to do it professionally
- Do pentesting for servers
- Bug bounties
- Malware research

...and thats it! Thank you for reading! ðŸ˜…
